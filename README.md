Reelphil
========

Reelphil is a 'Social Portal for Cinephiles'.

The major itch for starting this project was having to use multiple sites related to movies. Other
motivational factors were lack of decent mobile apps, having to buy premium features in some sites.

The data available from http://www.imdb.com/interfaces is built into a relational database.
Features are inspired from getglue.com, iCheckMovies.com and gomiso.com.

The project extensively utilizes free and open source software and is itself a free software available
under GNU GPL (General Public License) 3.0.
